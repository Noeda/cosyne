COSYNE
======

This is an implementation of Accelerated Neural Evolution through Cooperatively
Coevolved Synapses (COSYNE) for Haskell. Despite the word 'Neural' and
'Synapse' appearing in the name, this library is agnostic to if you are using a
neural network or some other construction (although the method is designed for
neural nets).
